# Module 01 Assignment

## Description

In this Assignment im gonna show my understanding of:

- Version Control
- Making a project
- Setting up my repository

## First git status output

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Second git status output

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working
directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit
-a")

## Purpose of the following Commands

- `mkdir`: its purpose is to make new directories in the system
- `cd`: its purpose is to change you to your desired directory.
- `code`: you use this command to open to your code editor through the git bash terminal
- `ls`: allows you to see all the files in your current directory

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- Collaborate with multiple people on one project
-If you lose the files you can recover everything from github because they are backup on it
- You can track all the changes and the different versions the project went through
- You can see why these changes where made because there are always comments on them
- Who can access certain parts can be controlled
- Different devs each can work on different aspects of the project by branching out the project with affecting the main branch
- Multiple devs can work on their own version of the same project and what ever changes each dev presents they will go with the one that is agreed upon and they will merge those changes with the main Branch.
- You can easily find out what you were doing last year if you went under inspection
- All changes and updates go to one place for easy access

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- `git init`: Creates a new git repository
- `git status`: shows the modified files and waits for your next commit
- `git add`: stages the files for the next commit
- `git commit`: commits those changes to the files
- `git push`: it pushes the changes from the local repository to the remote repository
- `git pull`: it pulls and downloads from whatever the remote repository has into the local repository
- `git log`: lists all the commits made, who made it and when it was made
- `git branch`: lists all the branches in the repository
- `git merge`: it merges the branch your working on the another branch
- `git checkout`: it's used to switch between branches
